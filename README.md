# Census-2011-Analysis
Repository for my work on the analysis of the Census data for India using MySQL workbench.<br>
### Dataset: 
- The data for this analysis was taken from Kaggle.
- It is basically the census data for India from the year 2011.
### Data Analysis using MySQL:
- Created MySQL scripts to analyse and group data on various parameters. 
- View the SQL script file over [here](https://github.com/AnityaGan9urde/Census-2011-Analysis/blob/main/Project_India.sql).
- Also generated Virtual Tables and exported them to use further.
